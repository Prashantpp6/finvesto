const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'What is SIP and how does it work?',
    a: "A SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a method of investing a fixed amount in a mutual fund at regular intervals — usually monthly. SIPs work by buying more units when markets are low and fewer when markets are high, averaging your cost over time. This removes the need to time the market.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How much should I invest every month?',
    a: "There's no universal answer — it depends on your income, expenses, goals, and timeline. A rough starting point: aim to invest at least 20–30% of your take-home Income. More importantly, start with whatever you can sustain without disrupting your lifestyle, then increase by 10% each year.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How does financial planning actually help me?',
    a: "Most people invest randomly — a SIP here, a FD there, LIC policy because someone insisted. Financial planning replaces this chaos with a clear map: where you stand today, where you want to go, and the most efficient route between the two.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How often should my portfolio be reviewed?',
    a: "At minimum, once a year — ideally twice. A review checks if your funds are still performing relative to their category, if your asset allocation still matches your goals and risk tolerance, and if there are tax-loss harvesting opportunities.",
  },
  {
    q: 'I already have investments. Can I still come to you?',
    a: "Absolutely — and this is often where the most value is found. We regularly find funds that are underperforming, duplicate holdings, insurance products that are underinsuring, and tax-inefficient structures.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I get started?',
    a: "Book a free 20-minute call. That's it. No documents, no paperwork, no pre-meeting homework. We'll have a practical conversation about where you currently stand, what you want to achieve, and what's getting in the way.",
